Project Setup
1. Setting Up the Environment

    Install Miniconda or Anaconda if you donâ€™t have it already.

    Clone or download this repository.

    Create the environment by running:

conda env create -f environment.yml

Activate the environment:

    conda activate mika

Then run python app.py to start the application

2. CUDA-Enabled OpenCV (Optional for Speed)

The environment provided uses CPU-only OpenCV by default. If you want to enable GPU acceleration with CUDA, you need to install cuda enabled opencv in the environment manually.

To check if OpenCV is using CUDA, run the following in Python:

import cv2
print(cv2.getBuildInformation())

Look for CUDA: YES in the output.


Notes:
- The wavelengths and frames are extracted from the image names. The pattern matching is done in the function load_images in image_processing/circle_detection.py
- If you want, you can set a default_path to an image folder that gets opened automatically upon startup in app.py, but this is not necessary
- It's only possible to assign n groups with n = number of spots * 2. This is currently hardcoded, if more groups are necessary, I can change this.
